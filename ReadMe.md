# Sanctuary Bot

Sanctuary Bot is a python bot design to deal with Sanctuary discord server needs.

# Setup

To run this application you will need python (we used version 3.9.0) but any version >= should do the trick.
DB Browser for SQLitle is a nice tool to have to help with the database.

This code will install all required libraries:
```
pip install discord.py apscheduler aiosqlite
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus
```
